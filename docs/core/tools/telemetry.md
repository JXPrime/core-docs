#.NET Core Tools Telemetry

The .NET Core tools include a [telemetry feature](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/2145) so that the .NET Team can collect usage information about the .NET Core Tools. It’s important that the team understands how the tools are being used so that we can improve them. The telemetry is only in the tools and does not affect your apps.

##Behavior

The telemetry feature is on by default. The data collected is anonymous in nature and will be published in an aggregated form for use by both Microsoft and community engineers under a Creative Commons license.

You can opt-out of the telemetry feature by setting an environment variable DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT (for example, export on OS X/Linux, set on Windows) to true (for example, “true”, 1). Doing this will stop the collection process from running.

##Data Points

The feature collects the following pieces of data:

- The command being used (for example, “build”, “restore”)
- The ExitCode of the command
- For test projects, the test runner being used
- The timestamp of invocation
- The framework used
- Whether runtime IDs are present in the “runtimes” node
- The CLI version being used

The feature will not collect any personal data, such as usernames or emails. It will not scan your code and not extract any project-level data that can be considered sensitive, such as name, repo or author (if you set those in your project.json). We want to know how the tools are used, not what you are building with the tools. If you find sensitive data being collected, that’s a bug. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues) and it will be fixed.

We use the [MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY EULA](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-eula) for the .NET Core Tools, which we also use for all .NET NuGet packages. We recently added a “DATA” section re-printed below, to enable telemetry from the tools. We want to stay with one EULA for .NET Core and only intend to collect data from the tools, not the runtime or libraries.

##Disclosure

When you first run the `dotnet` tool, you see the following text. This is how Microsoft notifies you about data collection. This same experience also initially populates your NuGet cache with the libraries in the .NET Core SDK, avoiding network calls for those libraries.

Telemetry
--------------

The .NET Core tools collect usage data in order to improve your experience.
The data is anonymous and does not include commandline arguments. The data is
collected by Microsoft and shared with the community.

You can opt out of telemetry by setting a DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT
environment variable to 1 using your favorite shell.

You can read more about .NET Core tools telemetry @ https://aka.ms/dotnet-cli-
telemetry.

Configuring...
-------------------

A command is running to initially populate your local package cache, to
improve restore speed and enable offline access. This command will take up to
a minute to complete and will only happen once. 
```
